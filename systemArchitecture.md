#  NaijaRoot System Architecture

##  Overview
*NaijaRoot* is a digital marketplace platform designed to connect *farmers, **buyers, and **logistic drivers* on a single, trusted system.  
It enables farmers to list and sell produce directly, buyers to purchase fresh goods, and drivers to deliver produce efficiently, all while ensuring secure payments and transparency.

This document provides a detailed technical blueprint of how NaijaRoot is structured and how its components communicate to create a seamless experience.

##  System Components

NaijaRoot’s architecture consists of three major layers:

| Layer | Description | Technology |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| *Frontend (Client-side)* | User interface for farmers, buyers, and drivers. Handles sign-up, listings, orders, and dashboards. | *React.js*, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS |
| *Backend (Server-side)* | Handles business logic, authentication, and API requests between the frontend and database. | *Node.js* with *Express.js* |
| *Database (Data Storage)* | Stores user data, product listings, transactions, and delivery records. | *Firebase Firestore (NoSQL)* |

---

##  Additional Integrations

| Functionality | Technology / API |
|----------------|------------------|
| *Payments* | Flutterwave API / Inter-bank transfer |
| *Map & Location* | Google Maps API |
| *Authentication* | Firebase Authentication |
| *Notifications* | Firebase Cloud Messaging |
| *File Storage (Images)* | Firebase Storage |

---

##  Component Communication Flow

Here’s how the components interact within the NaijaRoot ecosystem:

1. *User Interaction (Frontend):*  
   Farmers, buyers, and drivers use the web or mobile interface built with React.

2. *API Requests (Frontend → Backend):*  
   The frontend communicates with the Express.js backend via RESTful API endpoints for:
   - User registration & login  
   - Product listing & management  
   - Orders & delivery tracking  
   - Payment initiation and verification  

3. *Data Handling (Backend ↔ Database):*  
   - The backend reads/writes data from *Firebase Firestore* using SDKs and APIs.  
   - Real-time updates ensure instant data reflection across all dashboards.  

4. *Payment Processing:*  
   - Backend initiates transactions using *Flutterwave API*.  
   - An *escrow logic* holds payments until order confirmation.  

5. *Delivery Tracking:*  
   - Drivers’ locations are tracked using the *Google Maps API*.  
   - Order status is updated in real-time via Firebase.

6. *Notifications:*  
   - Firebase Cloud Messaging sends push notifications for new orders, delivery updates, or payment confirmation.

##  Security and Trust

- *Authentication:* All users authenticate via Firebase Auth (email/password or phone number).  
- *Escrow System:* Payments are temporarily held until both buyer and farmer confirm satisfaction.  
- *Data Encryption:* Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.  
- *Access Control:* Role-based access for Farmers, Buyers, and Drivers.  

---

##  Technical Feasibility

- *Scalable:* Firebase and Node.js allow handling of large concurrent requests efficiently.  
- *Reliable:* Real-time updates ensure data consistency across users.  
- *Secure:* End-to-end encryption, verified payments, and role-based control ensure system integrity.  
- *Maintainable:* Modular architecture enables easy updates and feature additions.

##  Design Philosophy

NaijaRoot is built with empathy for real users — especially rural farmers — which influences both design and technology decisions:
- *Offline accessibility* and *lightweight UI* for areas with poor connectivity.  
- *Voice assistance* to guide less literate users.  
- *Agent-assisted onboarding* to build trust and ensure adoption.  

---

##  Future Enhancements

- Add AI-powered *price prediction* for farm produce based on market trends.  
- Introduce *USSD support* for farmers without smartphones.  
- Launch *multi-language voice guides* (Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo).  
- Integrate *Blockchain-based produce traceability* for export validation.
